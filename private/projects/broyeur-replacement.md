# Broyeur Replacement

## 📋 Overview

Replace current broyeur in bathroom because it is too loud. Looking for a quieter solution.

## 🎯 Goals

- [ ] Research quiet broyeur models (specifically Sani Broyeur)
- [ ] Verify pipe compatibility (40mm vs 32mm output)
- [ ] Purchase and install new broyeur
- [ ] Reduce bathroom noise levels significantly

## 📝 Notes

### Current Status

Current broyeur is too loud and needs replacement.

### Options Being Considered

**Sanibroyeur Sanidouche+ - Quiet Version**
- Marketed as the quietest macerator pump available
- Standard output: **32mm discharge pipe**
- Current plumbing: 40mm pipe
- Pumping requirement: 2.5m vertical lift

### Research Findings (2026-02-03)

**Pipe Compatibility Analysis:**

**Standard Specification:**
- Sanidouche+ has 32mm discharge outlet (standard for most Saniflo units)
- Vertical pumping capacity: typically 3-4 meters (well above our 2.5m need)

**Using 32mm to 40mm Adapter:**

✅ **Pros:**
- 2.5m vertical lift is well within pump capacity - plenty of headroom
- Larger diameter = less back pressure (easier for pump)
- Short distance means reduced flow velocity is less problematic
- Many installations successfully use pipe size increases

⚠️ **Cons:**
- Reduced flow velocity in larger pipe (could affect self-cleaning)
- Not the "ideal" technical solution
- May affect warranty (needs verification)

**Verdict:** Should work for your situation given the modest 2.5m lift height and excess pump capacity.

### Next **Actions**

- [x] Contact Sanibroyeur dealer/installer to:
  - Confirm 32mm→40mm adapter compatibility for 2.5m vertical
  - Check warranty implications
  - Ask about similar installations they've done
- [ ] **DECISION MADE**: Going ahead with adapter solution
- [ ] Find best price in Netherlands (check multiple retailers)
- [ ] Purchase Sanidouche+ unit
- [ ] Purchase 32mm→40mm PVC adapter
- [ ] Schedule installation or arrange DIY installation
- [ ] Compare noise levels (dB) with current model

### Shopping List

**Required Items:**
- [ ] SFA Sanidouche+ macerator pump
- [ ] 32mm to 40mm PVC pipe adapter (Gamma/Praxis/Hornbach ~€5-10)

**Expected Price Range:** €400-550 for Sanidouche+ unit

### Questions to Answer

- Will using an adapter void the warranty?
- What are actual noise levels in dB compared to current model?
- Cost of professional installation vs DIY?
- Is replacing the 40mm pipe with 32mm feasible/cost-effective?
