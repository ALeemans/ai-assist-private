# Move to European & Privacy-Focused Tech Stack

## 📋 Overview

Complete migration away from American tech companies (Google, Microsoft) to European privacy-focused alternatives across all devices and services.

## 🎯 Goals

### Cloud Storage
- [ ] Research European cloud storage providers
- [ ] Evaluate options (storage space, price, features, privacy)
- [x] Select primary provider (Infomaniak Nextcloud)
- [ ] Set up account and test
- [ ] Migrate Google Drive files
- [ ] Migrate OneDrive files
- [ ] Update backup workflows
- [ ] Cancel Google/Microsoft subscriptions

### Email & Productivity
- [x] Set up Proton email
- [ ] Migrate primary email to Proton
- [ ] Set up Proton Calendar for personal use
- [x] Set up Joplin for notes (replacing OneNote)
- [x] Choose Nextcloud sync (Infomaniak)

### Devices & OS
- [x] Pre-order Jolla phone (Sailfish OS - European, privacy-focused)
- [ ] Receive and set up Jolla phone
- [ ] Plan Windows to Linux migration
- [ ] Choose Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, etc.)
- [ ] Test Linux in VM before migration
- [ ] Full migration to Linux

## 📝 Notes

### Current Storage

- **Google Drive**: [Note current usage and size]
- **OneDrive**: [Note current usage and size]
- **Total**: [Total GB needed]

### European Alternatives to Research

- **Proton Drive** (Switzerland) - Privacy-focused, encrypted
- **Tresorit** (Switzerland) - Zero-knowledge encryption
- **MEGA** (New Zealand, EU servers) - End-to-end encryption
- **pCloud** (Switzerland) - Lifetime plans available
- **Nextcloud** (Self-hosted, EU servers) - Full control
- **Internxt** (Spain) - Privacy-first, open source
- **Filen** (Germany) - Zero-knowledge encryption

### Key Requirements

- [ ] European-based (GDPR compliant)
- [ ] End-to-end encryption
- [ ] Desktop sync client

## 📧 Email & Calendar Strategy
x] Installed Proton email
- [ ] Migrate primary email to Proton
- [ ] Start using Proton Calendar for personal events
- [ ] Keep Google Calendar active for ai-assist integration

### Notes Integration
- [x] Switched from OneNote to Joplin (open-source, privacy-focused)
- [x] Installed Joplin on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Set up Infomaniak Nextcloud for Joplin sync
- [ ] Build Joplin API integration for ai-assist

## 📱 Mobile Strategy

### Jolla Phone (Sailfish OS)
**Pre-ordered**: 2026-02-02

**Why Jolla/Sailfish OS:**
- European company (Finland)
- Sailfish OS: Linux-based mobile OS
- Privacy-focused, no Google services
- Support for Android apps (if needed)
- Independent from US tech giants

**Setup Plan:**
- [ ] Receive Jolla phone (expected delivery TBD)
- [ ] Set up Sailfish OS
- [ ] Install Proton apps (email, calendar, VPN)
- [ ] Install Joplin mobile
- [ ] Configure Nextcloud sync
- [ ] Test Android app compatibility layer
- [ ] Migrate from current phone

## 💻 Desktop OS Strategy

### Windows → Linux Migration

**Timeline**: To be determined (future)

**Considerations:**
- **Linux Distributions to Evaluate:**
  - Ubuntu (user-friendly, large community)
  - Fedora (cutting-edge, Red Hat backed)
  - Linux Mint (Windows-like, beginner-friendly)
  - Pop!_OS (gaming/developer focused)
  - Manjaro (Arch-based, user-friendly)

**Migration Steps (When Ready):**
- [ ] Test Linux distributions in VirtualBox/VMware
- [ ] Choose preferred distribution
- [ ] Verify all work software compatibility (Power BI, Azure tools, etc.)
- [ ] Plan dual-boot vs full migration
- [ ] Backup all data
- [ ] Install Linux
- [ ] Migrate workflows and configurations
**Proton for Personal Use:**
- Primary email: Proton Mail (privacy-focused, E2E encrypted)
- Personal calendar: Proton Calendar (privacy-focused)
- Cloud storage: Proton Drive (evaluating)

**Google Calendar - Limited Use:**
- Keep Google Calendar **only** for ai-assist reminder sync integration
- Reason: Proton has no public API for remote access (zero-knowledge architecture)
- Minimal personal data stored, primarily automated reminder events
- Alternative European options (Nextcloud, Fastmail) would require migration effort

### Migration Status
- [x] Created Proton email account
- [ ] Migrate primary email to Proton
- [ ] Start using Proton Calendar for personal events
- [ ] Keep Google Calendar active for ai-assist integration
- [ ] Mobile apps
- [ ] Reasonable pricing
- [ ] Sufficient storage space
- [ ] Good performance

### Migration Plan

1. **Week 1-2**: Research and evaluation
2. **Week 3**: Sign up and test chosen provider
3. **Week 4**: Start migration (non-critical files first)
4. **Week 5-6**: Full migration
5. **Week 7**: Verify everything, cancel old subscriptions

## 💡 Ideas & Thoughts

- Consider self-hosted Nextcloud for maximum control?
- Keep some redundancy during transition
- Document what's stored where
- Update family/friends about new sharing methods
