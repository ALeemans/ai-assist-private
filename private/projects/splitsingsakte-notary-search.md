# Splitsingsakte Notary Search

## Project Goal
Find and select a notary to handle the splitsingsakte amendment required for the schuifpui installation project.

## Background
The schuifpui (sliding door) installation may require changes to the splitsingsakte (apartment division deed). This is a legal document that defines property boundaries and may need updating for structural changes.

## Key Questions for Each Notary

- [ ] Cost estimate for this type of work?
- [ ] Expected timeline from start to completion?
- [ ] Do they coordinate with VVE (homeowners associations)?
- [ ] What documentation is needed from me?
- [ ] Are there any prerequisites before starting?

## Selection Criteria
- **Experience**: Must have experience with splitsingsakte amendments
- **Cost**: Compare quotes from multiple notaries
- **Timeline**: Faster is better, but quality matters
- **VVE Coordination**: Prefer notaries who handle VVE communication
- **Communication**: Responsive and clear communication

## Next Steps

2. If no response within 1 week or unsatisfactory quotes, contact additional notaries
3. Compare at least 3 quotes before deciding
4. Verify with VVE if there are any preferred notaries
5. Schedule consultation with top 2-3 candidates

## Timeline
