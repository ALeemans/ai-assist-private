# Tree Trimming Project

## Overview
Trim the tree in the garden - remove approximately 1-1.5 meters from the top and trim the sides to improve shape and manage growth.

## Objectives
- Remove 1-1.5 meters from the top of the tree
- Trim sides to shape and control spread
- Maintain tree health and aesthetics
- Ensure safe and proper pruning technique

## Resources

### Expert Advice
- **Father-in-law**: Knowledgeable about gardening - consult for:
  - Best time of year to trim
  - Proper cutting techniques
  - Which branches to remove/keep
  - Tree health assessment
  - Tool recommendations

### Learning Materials
- [ ] Find good instruction video on tree trimming
- [ ] Research proper pruning techniques for specific tree type
- [ ] Learn about timing (season/weather considerations)

## Planning Checklist

### Preparation
- [ ] Identify tree type (important for timing and technique)
- [ ] Consult with father-in-law on approach
- [ ] Find and watch instruction videos
- [ ] Check weather forecast (avoid rain, strong wind)
- [ ] Determine best season for trimming this tree type

### Tools & Equipment Needed
- [ ] Pruning saw or hand saw
- [ ] Pruning shears/secateurs for smaller branches
- [ ] Ladder (stable, appropriate height)
- [ ] Safety glasses/goggles
- [ ] Gloves (gardening/work gloves)
- [ ] Rope (for lowering larger branches safely)
- [ ] Tarp or sheet (for collecting branches)
- [ ] First aid kit (safety first!)

### Safety Considerations
- [ ] Ensure ladder is stable
- [ ] Have someone spot/assist if possible
- [ ] Check for power lines nearby
- [ ] Wear appropriate protective equipment
- [ ] Don't overreach - move ladder frequently
- [ ] Be aware of falling branches

### Execution
- [ ] Schedule time with good weather
- [ ] Coordinate with father-in-law if he wants to help/supervise
- [ ] Make clean cuts at proper angles
- [ ] Step back frequently to assess shape
- [ ] Take photos before/after

### Disposal
- [ ] Arrange green waste disposal
- [ ] Check gemeentelijk groenafval collection schedule
- [ ] Consider composting smaller branches
- [ ] Bundle larger branches for pickup

## Questions to Ask Father-in-Law
1. What type of tree is it?
2. What's the best time of year to trim it?
3. How much can safely be removed without stressing the tree?
4. What's the proper cutting angle and technique?
5. Should any diseased or dead branches be prioritized?
6. Does he have tools I can borrow?
7. Would he like to help or supervise?

## Videos to Search For
Search terms:
- "How to prune/trim [tree type]"
- "Tree topping techniques"
- "Safe tree trimming for beginners"
- "Garden tree maintenance Netherlands"
- "Boom snoeien instructie" (Dutch)

## Important Notes
- **Timing matters**: Different trees should be trimmed at different times
- **Don't remove too much**: General rule is no more than 25% of tree's canopy in one season
- **Clean cuts heal better**: Use sharp tools, cut at proper angle
- **Safety first**: If tree is very tall or near power lines, consider professional help

## Timeline
- **Research & Planning**: Week of Feb 4-10
- **Consultation with father-in-law**: TBD
- **Execution**: Best time TBD (depends on tree type and season)
- **Follow-up**: Monitor tree health after trimming

**Remember**: When in doubt, trim less rather than more. Trees can always be trimmed again later, but you can't put branches back!
