# Schuifpui (Sliding Doors) Installation Project

## Overview
Installing sliding doors (schuifpui) at the back of our apartment. This requires coordination with VVE, notary changes, and potentially legal/administrative assistance.

## Goal
Replace current back doors with modern sliding doors (schuifpui) to improve access to outdoor space and modernize the apartment.

## Current Status

- 📋 VVE approval process
- ⚖️ Notary changes required
- 🤝 Need external assistance (Vereniging Eigen Huis)

## Challenges
- **VVE Coordination**: Need approval from homeowners association
- **Notary Availability**: All notaries in Netherlands are very busy, hard to get appointments
- **Knowledge Gap**: Lack experience with this type of project, need expert assistance
- **Administrative Complexity**: Changes to property deed/documents required

## Key Stakeholders
- **VVE (Vereniging van Eigenaars)**: Homeowners association - approval needed
- **Notaris**: Legal changes to property documents
