# Contact Notary for Schuifpui Changes

Contact notaries to schedule an appointment for the required changes related to the schuifpui installation. Notaries in Netherlands are very busy, so start calling early.

**Actions:**
- Make list of notaries in your area
- Call multiple notaries (they're all busy!)
- Explain you need changes for apartment renovation (schuifpui)
- Ask what documents/information they need
- Schedule earliest available appointment
- Confirm costs upfront

**Tips:**
- Be persistent - may need to call multiple times
- Ask if they have cancellation list
- Prepare to wait several weeks for appointment
- Have VVE details ready when calling
