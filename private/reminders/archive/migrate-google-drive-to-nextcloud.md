# Migrate Google Drive to Nextcloud

## 📌 What

Migrate all files from Google Drive to Infomaniak Nextcloud as part of the European tech stack migration.

## ❓ Why

Moving away from American tech companies to European privacy-focused alternatives. Nextcloud provides a complete Google Drive replacement with better integration (already using it for Joplin sync, can add Calendar, Contacts, Office).

## ✅ Completion Criteria

- [ ] Set up Infomaniak Nextcloud account (if not done for Joplin)
- [ ] Review current Google Drive storage usage
- [ ] Install Nextcloud desktop sync client
- [ ] Create folder structure in Nextcloud
- [ ] Download all files from Google Drive
- [ ] Upload files to Nextcloud
- [ ] Verify all files transferred successfully
- [ ] Set up automatic sync
- [ ] Update sharing links (if any)
- [ ] Cancel Google Drive subscription (if applicable)

## 📝 Notes

**Storage Plan:**
- Free: 15GB (test with this first)
- Paid: 250GB for €6/month (upgrade if needed)

**Benefits of Nextcloud over Proton Drive:**
- Already using for Joplin sync → consolidation
- Desktop sync client (Proton Drive lacks this)
- Full Google Drive replacement (Calendar, Contacts, Office)
- Better value: 250GB for €6 vs Proton's 200GB for €4
- WebDAV support for other apps

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Start with non-critical files
2. Organize as you migrate
3. Keep Google Drive active initially as backup
4. Gradually shift workflows to Nextcloud
5. Only cancel Google Drive after full verification
