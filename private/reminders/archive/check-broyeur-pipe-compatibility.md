# Check Broyeur Pipe Compatibility

## 📌 What

Research and verify if the quiet Sani Broyeur model supports 40mm pipe output (instead of standard 32mm).

## ❓ Why

Planning to replace the current loud broyeur with a quiet Sani Broyeur version. Need to ensure the output pipe diameter is compatible with existing 40mm plumbing before making purchase decision.

## ✅ Completion Criteria

- [ ] Find technical specifications for Sani Broyeur quiet model
- [ ] Confirm output pipe diameter (40mm vs 32mm)
- [ ] If 32mm only, research adapter options
- [ ] Document findings in project file

## 📝 Notes

Current broyeur is too loud and needs replacement. The Sani Broyeur has a very quiet version that seems like a good option, but pipe compatibility must be verified first.

**Key Question**: Does the output support 40mm pipes or only 32mm?

**Research Completed (2026-02-03):**

Sanidouche+ specifications:
- Standard output: 32mm discharge pipe
- Vertical capacity: 3-4m (our need: 2.5m)
- Using 32mm→40mm adapter: **Likely feasible** given our modest 2.5m lift
- Pump has excess capacity for our situation

**Recommendation**: Contact dealer to confirm adapter compatibility and warranty status. Detailed analysis in project file.
