# Prepare Hospital Bag

Pack hospital bag for labor and delivery. Better to have it ready early (around week 35-36) in case baby arrives early.

**Include:**
- Mom's essentials (ID, insurance, toiletries, comfortable clothes)
- Baby's going-home outfit and blanket
- Partner's snacks and charger
- Birth plan
- Camera

**Tip**: Have car seat already installed in car!
