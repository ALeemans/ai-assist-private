# Organize Babyshower Planning Group

## 📌 What

Contact girlfriend's friends and create an app group (WhatsApp/Signal/etc.) to collaboratively plan the babyshower party.

## ❓ Why

Planning a non-traditional babyshower that includes all friends (not just women), held in the evening with a party atmosphere and drinks. Need to coordinate with her friends on:
- Date and time
- Location
- Food and drinks
- Activities/games
- Guest list
- Budget and contributions

## ✅ Completion Criteria

- [ ] Contact girlfriend's friends about the babyshower idea
- [ ] Create app group for planning coordination
- [ ] Share initial concept (co-ed evening party with drinks)
- [ ] Start discussing potential dates

## 📝 Notes

This is a non-traditional babyshower:
- Mixed gender guest list (all our friends, not women-only)
- Evening event (not afternoon tea)
- Party atmosphere with alcohol available
- More casual/fun vibe than traditional babyshower

Make sure to involve her friends early so they can help plan something she'll love!
