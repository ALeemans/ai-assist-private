# Daily Log - 2026-02-02

## 🌅 Morning Review

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**
1. Set up Joplin Integration (open-source notes app) - Due today!
2. 
3. 

**Reminders Due:**
- **TODAY**: Setup Joplin Integration (Due: Feb 2) - Switched from OneNote
- Contact Notary Schuifpui (Due: Feb 3)

- AI-Driven Dimensional Modeling (currently open)
- Baby Preparation - May 2026

## 💭 Thoughts & Ideas

- Decided on hybrid approach for European migration: Proton for email/personal calendar, keep Google Calendar for ai-assist API integration
- Switched from OneNote to Joplin for notes - better privacy, open source, has REST API, European sync options
- Pre-ordered Jolla phone (Sailfish OS) - European, privacy-focused mobile OS
- Planning eventual migration from Windows to Linux (future)
