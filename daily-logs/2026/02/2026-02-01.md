## 📝 Notes

**Baby Preparation:**
Added three new baby preparation items:
- Electric bakfiets research (second-hand, trusted dealer)
- Electric baby swing (marktplaats.nl)
- Parental leave planning - need to research Dutch regulations and create detailed schedule

**System Improvements:**
Updated instructions so Copilot will:
- Automatically check for and update related project files
- Create daily logs if they don't exist
- Update daily logs at session close

**OneNote Integration:**
Explored options for mobile note capture. Google Keep has no API, so decided to build OneNote integration using Microsoft Graph API. This will enable quick thought capture on phone with automatic import to the knowledge base. Set up scheduled for tomorrow.

## 🔄 Tomorrow

- Set up OneNote integration (Microsoft Graph API authentication)
- Continue with daily tasks and reminders
