## 📝 Notes

**Olympic Calendar Setup:**
- Successfully added all 45 Dutch team events from TeamNL website
- Events run from Feb 6-22 (opening ceremony to closing)
- Sports covered: Schaatsen, Shorttrack, Snowboarden, Skeleton, Bobslee, Kunstschaatsen
- All events properly synchronized to "Anne Leemans" personal calendar
- Opening ceremony today at 20:00!

**Technical Notes:**
- TeamNL website uses JavaScript rendering, making direct scraping difficult
- Copy-pasting visible text was most efficient solution
- Enhanced sync-reminders-to-calendar.py to support:
  - Custom due_time (instead of defaulting by priority)
  - Custom duration_minutes
  - Custom calendar_color
  - Custom reminder_minutes_before

## 🔄 Tomorrow
