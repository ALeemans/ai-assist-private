# Daily Log - 2026-02-04

## 🌅 Morning Review

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**
1. Email Learning Analytics team about Role Based Security View
2. Work on active DevOps user stories
3. Update project documentation

**Reminders Due:**
- Email Learning Analytics team (Role Based Security View) ✅

**Projects Active:**
- Self-Service View Creation System (testing phase)
- Copilot Hybrid Dashboards (planning)
- Baby Preparation
- European Cloud Migration

## 💭 Thoughts & Ideas

- Hybrid Copilot dashboard approach: use pre-generated results with prompts as filters
- Need to define 5 core prompts for stakeholder evaluation
- Difference between OSDG (ML + keywords) and JRC SDG Mapper (pure keyword-based)

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Emailed Learning Analytics team about RBAC feature
- [x] Completed User Story #145883 (SEAA woorden verwerken)
- [x] Updated and renamed SQL metadata project to "Self-Service View Creation System"
- [x] Translated project file to Dutch for repository use
- [x] Added author information to all project files
- [x] Scheduled call with Vereniging Eigen Huis (Friday 10:00)
- [x] Created User Story #146351 for Copilot Hybrid Dashboards
- [x] Updated baby preparation project with Witsenkade checklist items
- [x] Created tree trimming project
- [x] Set up prompt definition template for Copilot Dashboard project

## 🚧 In Progress

- [ ] User Story #146271: Testing SQL validator and metadata extractor (more tests tomorrow)
- [ ] Defining 5 core prompts for Copilot Dashboard
- [ ] Baby preparation planning

## 📝 Notes

**Work:**
- Self-service view system renamed - better reflects full scope beyond metadata
- Testing phase nearly complete, ready for backend handoff soon
- New Copilot dashboard concept created - hybrid approach with filtered prompts

**Personal:**
- Vereniging Eigen Huis will call Friday at 10:00 about schuifpui
- Witsenkade provided comprehensive baby items checklist
- Need to identify tree type before trimming project

**Learnings:**
- OSDG uses ML + keyword consensus, JRC uses transparent keyword-only approach
- Both have different strengths depending on use case

## 🔄 Tomorrow

- Follow up on IT Security approval
- Run final tests on SQL validator
- Research baby gemeente registration requirements
- Continue defining Copilot dashboard prompts
